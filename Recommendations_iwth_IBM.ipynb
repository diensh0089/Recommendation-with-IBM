Recommendations with IBM
In this notebook, you will be putting your recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page. Either way assure that your code passes the project RUBRIC. Please save regularly.

By following the table of contents, you will build out a number of different methods for making recommendations that can be used for different situations.

Part I : Exploratory Data Analysis
Use the dictionary and cells below to provide some insight into the descriptive statistics of the data.

1. What is the distribution of how many articles a user interacts with in the dataset? Provide a visual and descriptive statistics to assist with giving a look at the number of times each user interacts with an article.

# Show relevant facts about the data
df.groupby('email').count()['article_id'].describe()

# Take a look at the articles with the highest article_counts
df_new = df.groupby(['email']).size().reset_index(name='article_counts')
df_new = df_new.sort_values(by=['article_counts'], ascending=False)
df_new.head(8)

max_views_by_user = df.groupby('email').count()['article_id'].max()
print("The maximum number of user-article interactions by any 1 user is {}.".format(max_views_by_user))
50% of individuals interact with 3.0 number of articles or fewer.
The maximum number of user-article interactions by any 1 user is 364.
2. Explore and remove duplicate articles from the df_content dataframe.

# Find and explore duplicate articles
df_content.duplicated(['article_id']).sum()

# Show the article_ids which are duplicate articles
df_cont_dupl = np.where(df_content.duplicated(['article_id']) == True)
df_cont_dupl[0]
array([365, 692, 761, 970, 971])
# Show the rows in the dataset and the title of the duplicate articles
for id in df_cont_dupl[0]:

df_content.shape

# Remove any rows that have the same article_id - only keep the first
df_cont_dropDupl = df_content.drop_duplicates(subset='article_id', keep='first')

# Take another look at the number of rows and columns in the dataset - now there are 5 rows less
df_cont_dropDupl.shape
(1051, 5)
3. Use the cells below to find:

a. The number of unique articles that have an interaction with a user.
b. The number of unique articles in the dataset (whether they have any interactions or not).
c. The number of unique users in the dataset. (excluding null values)
d. The number of user-article interactions in the dataset.

# Show the number of unique articles, titles and users in the dataset
df.nunique()
article_id     714
title          714
email         5148
dtype: int64
# Take a look at the number of user-article interactions
df.shape
(45993, 3)
unique_articles = df.article_id.nunique()
print('The number of unique articles that have an interaction with a user: {}'.format(unique_articles))

total_articles = df_cont_dropDupl.shape[0]
print('The number of unique articles in the dataset: {}'.format(total_articles))

unique_users = df.email.nunique() 
print('The number of unique users in the dataset: {}'.format(unique_users))

user_article_interactions = df.shape[0]
print('The number of user-article interactions in the dataset: {}'.format(user_article_interactions))
The number of unique articles that have an interaction with a user: 714
The number of unique articles in the dataset: 1051
The number of unique users in the dataset: 5148
The number of user-article interactions in the dataset: 45993
4. Use the cells below to find the most viewed article_id, as well as how often it was viewed. After talking to the company leaders, the email_mapper function was deemed a reasonable way to map users to ids. There were a small number of null values, and it was found that all of these null values likely belonged to a single user (which is how they are stored using the function below).

# Take a look at the article_ids sorted by the number of times they were viewed
df_view_most = df.groupby(['article_id']).count()
df_view_most.head()
df_view_most.sort_values(by=['email'], ascending=False)

It looks like you have everything right here! Nice job!
Part II: Rank-Based Recommendations
Unlike in the earlier lessons, we don't actually have ratings for whether a user liked an article or not. We only know that a user has interacted with an article. In these cases, the popularity of an article can really only be based on how often an article was interacted with.

1. Fill in the function below to return the n top articles ordered with most interactions as the top. Test your function using the tests below.

df_func = df.groupby(['article_id']).count().reset_index()
df_func = df_func.sort_values(by='user_id', ascending=False)
df_func.iloc[:5]
article_id	title	user_id
699	1429.0	937	937
625	1330.0	927	927
701	1431.0	671	671

Part III: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
1. Use the function below to reformat the df dataframe to be shaped with users as the rows and articles as the columns.

Each user should only appear in each row once.
Each article should only show up in one column.
If a user has interacted with an article, then place a 1 where the user-row meets for that article-column. It does not matter how many times a user has interacted with the article, all entries where a user has interacted with an article should be a 1.
If a user has not interacted with an item, then place a zero where the user-row meets for that article-column.
Use the tests to make sure the basic structure of your matrix matches what is expected by the solution.

# create the user-article matrix with 1's and 0's

def create_user_item_matrix(df):
    '''
    INPUT:
    df - pandas dataframe with article_id, title, user_id columns
    
    OUTPUT:
    user_item - user item matrix 
    
    Description:
    Return a matrix with user ids as rows and article ids on the columns with 1 values where a user interacted with 
    an article and a 0 otherwise
    '''
    # Fill in the function here
   
    # Drop the duplicate rows and create new rows and columns
    user_item = df.drop_duplicates().groupby(['user_id', 'article_id']).size().unstack()

    # Fill in NaN with '0'
    user_item = user_item.fillna(0)
    
    # Convert to integer
    user_item = user_item.astype('int')
    
    return user_item # return the user_item matrix 

user_item = create_user_item_matrix(df)

## Tests: You should just need to run this cell.  Don't change the code.
assert user_item.shape[0] == 5149, "Oops!  The number of users in the user-article matrix doesn't look right."
assert user_item.shape[1] == 714, "Oops!  The number of articles in the user-article matrix doesn't look right."

print("You have passed our quick tests!  Please proceed!")
You have passed our quick tests!  Please proceed!
2. Complete the function below which should take a user_id and provide an ordered list of the most similar users to that user (from most similar to least similar). The returned result should not contain the provided user_id, as we know that each user is similar to him/herself. Because the results for each user here are binary, it (perhaps) makes sense to compute similarity as the dot product of two users.

Use the tests to test your function.

4. Now we are going to improve the consistency of the user_user_recs function from above.

Instead of arbitrarily choosing when we obtain users who are all the same closeness to a given user - choose the users that have the most total article interactions before choosing those with fewer article interactions.
Instead of arbitrarily choosing articles from the user where the number of recommended articles starts below m and ends exceeding m, choose articles with the articles with the most total interactions before choosing those with fewer total interactions. This ranking should be what would be obtained from the top_articles function you wrote earlier.

6. If we were given a new user, which of the above functions would you be able to use to make recommendations? Explain. Can you think of a better way we might make recommendations? Use the cell below to explain a better method for new users.

You could use knowledge based recommendations (use knowledge about items that meet user specifications to recommend items).
The user can be provided with the articles that have the highest user-article-interactions.
7. Using your existing functions, provide the top 10 recommended articles you would provide for the a new user below. You can test your function against our thoughts to make sure we are all on the same page with how we might make a recommendation.

new_user = '0.0'
